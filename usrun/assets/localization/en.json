    "aboutUSRUN_4": "- The first way is /u:s:rʌn/, in which the “US” part stands for the university's name. Hence, USRUN can be interpreted as “running sessions of the US members” or “the US members are ready to run together”.",
    "aboutUSRUN_5": "- The latter pronunciation is /ʌs:rʌn/, the “US” here represents all the people who run to achieve a healthier lifestyle. In this case, USRUN carries the message of “let’s run, we run together”.",
    "aboutUSRUN_6": "This application identifies members of HCMUS as its target audience. However, any person who are interested in the app or running in general are welcomed to download USRUN and ultilize it for their running activities.",
